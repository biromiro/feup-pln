    "The bag-of-words model is very simplistic and ignores word order. Perhaps we can do better if we make use of a bi-gram representation: generate features corresponding to pairs of consecutive tokens. Hopefully, in some cases we will be able to distinguish negations, such as in *not expensive* vs *expensive*.\n",

If we use a range (1,2), for instance, we'll get both individual tokens as well as bi-grams. Perhaps when doing so it will be a good idea not to get rid of stop words, since the stop word list we have used before includes negation tokens.\n",
